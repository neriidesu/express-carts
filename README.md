Express Carts is a serverside Fabric mod<!-- modrinth_exclude.start --> for Minecraft<!-- modrinth_exclude.end --> which adds a new type of minecart with a faster speed,
improved behaviour, and new features.
It gives your players a better minecart experience without requiring clientside mods or breaking any technical builds.

- Minecarts become a useful (and fun!) method of travel
- Twice the speed of vanilla minecarts (configurable)
- Uses Minecraft's experimental Minecart Improvements physics without requiring it be enabled for the world
- Vanilla minecarts unaffected, so it doesn't break technical builds or cartstone
- No clientside mods required (and they never will be)
- Inspired by TaterCart, though without aiming to support all its features

It adds the "Express Minecart", which has a default maximum speed of 16 blocks per second (compared to the vanilla 8) and uses
the behaviours from Minecraft's Minecart Improvements experimental feature without requiring that feature to be enabled
for the world. The behaviour and speed of all vanilla minecarts is unaffected, allowing technical cartstone builds to
coexist with passenger rail networks that make use of faster Express Minecarts.

## Installation

Install the Express Carts mod itself and ensure you also have Fabric API present.
The mod also depends on Polymer, MixinExtras, the Server Translations API, and BetterConfig, but these are bundled and need not be installed.

However, we highly recommend making Polymer's generated resource pack available to players,
such as by using [Polymer's AutoHost module](https://polymer.pb4.eu/latest/user/resource-pack-hosting/)
which requires installing that mod separately.

## Usage

An Express Minecart can be crafted using a normal minecart and a redstone torch.
The Express Minecart item will be seen by Vanilla players as a normal minecart item with an enchantment glint,
and players with the Polymer-generated resource pack will see a custom item texture.

Only a normal (passenger) minecart variant is available, not any of the other Vanilla minecart types.
It is used exactly like normal, it just has twice the maximum speed and substantially improved physics behaviours.

When placed in the world, an Express Minecart will appear as a minecart with a red carpet inside, to distinguish it from a normal minecart.

### Braking

If the configuration option `brakingEnabled` is `true` (the default), a player can hold their backwards movement key
while inside an Express Minecart to slow the minecart down. The acceleration applied is configurable.

## Configuration

Express Carts can be configured by using the commands under `/config expresscarts`, or by editing `config/expresscarts/config.json`
while the server is stopped. The following configuration options are available:

- `maxMinecartSpeed` (default 16): The maximum speed that can be reached by Express Minecarts, in blocks per second.
- `waterSpeedMultiplier` (default 0.5): The scaling factor applied to an Express Minecart's maximum speed when it is in water.
- `brakingEnabled` (default `true`): Whether players can hold the backwards movement key to brake.
- `brakeSlowdown` (default 0.8): Amount by which an Express Minecart's velocity is scaled each tick their passenger holds the brakes.
